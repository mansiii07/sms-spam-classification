# 📩 SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a **Machine Learning-based SMS Spam Classifier** that predicts whether a given SMS/Email is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  
It is built using **Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, and Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, etc.)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Multiple ML models tested (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Best model saved and deployed
- Interactive **Streamlit Web App**
